# pair-chat-tiagostutz

This is a project from 2004! Here historical purposes üòç

This was a chat server I pair programmed with my brother, Tiago Stutz, while he was at university in Londrina, PR, Brazil in 2004! I think it was one of the first things we did by pairing up together from a loooong list of things we did together in our lives ‚ù§Ô∏è.

It is based on the old Java/Swing.
